# Socket Packet Protocol
A protocol that allows the sending of packets through TCP sockets,currently written in Java and Python. The protocol allows for communication between each library. (A Python packet server can communicate with a Java packet client)
While the library isn't documented, the examples contain explanations on how to use the library correctly. Enjoy!
